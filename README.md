# Async and Multithreaded Programming in .NET
This project explores asynchronous programming and multithreading in .NET. The purpose of this project was to write some
example code for a demo alongside a PPT presentation on this topic.

## Requirements
In order to run this application you'll need to install [.NET Core 2.2 or higher](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

This project also requires some features that are only available in C# 7.1 or higher, so please make sure you set this in your
project properties. Here's some more information on how you can enable the latest C# features:

Because this is a .NET Core console application, this can be run on both Windows and Mac using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)!

## Notes
This is by no means, production ready code! It was simply an exercise to practice the following concepts using a "real world"
scenario:
  * Asyncronous programming
    * The `async` keyword
    * The `await` keyword
  * Multithreading
    * Using `Parallel.ForEach`
  * Design patterns
    * Factory pattern
    * Strategy pattern
